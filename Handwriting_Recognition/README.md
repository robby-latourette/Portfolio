# Handwriting Recognition
This was an assignment I did for school in March 2022.

Utilizing the popular MNIST dataset, This program allows the user to write a digit 0-9,
and then the program will predict what number they just wrote.

The point of the program was to explore handling large datasets, using tkinter, and sklearn's RandomForestClassifier

I couldn't include the CSV I used to train the model because it was too large,
but if you would like to try it yourself, you can find the dataset here: https://deepai.org/dataset/mnist
