## Summary
During my first year of college, I developed an obseesion with old video games, specifically arcade machines. 
I wanted a machine of my own, but when researching arcade machines, I discovered three things that should have been obvious from the beginning.

1) Arcade machines are big

2) Arcade machines are expensive

3) Arcade machines usually only have 1 game

While researching however, I also discovered something else, a sub-community of arcade collectors that build their own machines.
This solved all of my problems with purchasing an arcade machine, since I could control the form factor of the machine, control what games I run on the emulator, and it would only cost around $150 dollars since it is powered by a raspberry pi.
