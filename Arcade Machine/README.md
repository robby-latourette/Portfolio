# Hand-Made Arcade Machine

## Summary
During my first year of college, I developed an obseesion with old video games, specifically arcade machines. 
I wanted a machine of my own, but when researching arcade machines, I discovered three things that should have been obvious from the beginning.

1) Arcade machines are big

2) Arcade machines are expensive

3) Arcade machines usually only have 1 game
