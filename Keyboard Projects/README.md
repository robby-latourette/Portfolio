# Custom Keyboards ⌨️
It's safe to say that I'm a bit of a keyboard enthusiast. 
While battling some typing-related wrist strain, a friend of mine introduced me to the world of custom keyboards.
I enjoyed seeing the creativity in other people's keyboard builds, but it didn't interest me all that much.
That is until I discovered the keyboard sub-culture that is split, ergonomic keyboards. 
I instantly bought the supplies I needed to build my own keyboard.
After I purchased the keyboard parts, I taught myself how to solder as well as how to work with microprocessors, the ATmega32U4 to be exact, and got building.

Over the years that followed, I've built many mechanical keyboards, and here are three of my favorites.

## Keebio Viterbi
The Viterbi is a 70% Split Ortholinear keyboard, 
this one is equipped with lubricated Gateron black keyswitches and MDA Big Bang keycaps. 
I didn't get a case for it, instead opting for PCB plates instead, 
because I felt like I didn't need it to look fancy since it rarely leaves my room at home. 
I also wanted to save some money and cases are expensive to custom make.
This has been my main keyboard for the past 3-4 years. 
It's a joy to type on and is what ignited my passion for split keyboards.

## Mysterium
This was definitely the most difficult keyboard build I have done, mostly because I sourced all of the parts myself. 
Two of my friends and I found some open-source files for a tenkeyless (TKL) keyboard called 'Mysterium', 
so we sent the PCB files to a PCB manufacturer and the case files to a CNC company. 
While the PCBs were being printed and the cases were being milled, we ordered all of the smaller electrical components we needed, 
such as diodes, microprocessors, resistors, capacitors, etc.
After soldering all of the electrical components, I installed the Soft Panda Black key switches and the PBT Chalk key caps.
After typing on split, ortholinear boards for so long, I decided to give this keyboard to my Mom, because she hated her cheap, old keyboard.

## Keebio BFO-9000
I love this keyboard, because it is very over-the-top. 
Firstly, it's ugly as hell. 
The keycaps are from a grab bag of random, unused keycaps I bought from a keycap manufacture, and created something called a 'Grabbag-Board', (aka Barf-Board, Puke-board).
It truly is a face only a mother could love, and for that, I absolutely adore it.

The thing I enjoy most is the absolutely massive size of the keyboard. 
The name 'BFO' stands for 'Big F\*cking Ortholinear'.
Most split ortholinear boards are anywhere from 60%-75% the size of a normal, 108-key keyboard, but this one has the full 108-keys.

For the key switches, I am using Kailh Box Navy switches which were the heaviest and loudest switches I could find.
They are so loud that many offices ban them for being too noisy.
Why did I pick these switches? 
I have a heavy key stroke, and I like super loud switches, simple as.
