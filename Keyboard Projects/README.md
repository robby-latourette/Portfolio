# Custom Keyboards ⌨️
It's safe to say that I'm a bit of a keyboard enthusiast. 
While battling some typing-related wrist strain, a friend of mine introduced me to the world of custom keyboards.
I enjoyed seeing the creativity in other people's keyboard builds, but it didn't interest me all that much.
That is until I discovered the keyboard sub-culture that is split, ergonomic keyboards. 
I instantly bought the supplies I needed to build my own keyboard.
After I purchased the keyboard parts, I taught myself how to solder as well as how to work with microprocessors, the ATmega32U4 to be exact, and got building.

Over the years that followed, I've built many mechanical keyboards, and here are three of my favorites.

# Keebio Viterbi
The Viterbi is a 70% Split Ortholinear keyboard, 
this one is equipped with lubricated Gateron black keyswitches and MDA Big Bang keycaps.
This has been my main keyboard for the past 3-4 years. 
It's a joy to type on and is what ignited my passion for split keyboards.
